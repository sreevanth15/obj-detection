# obj-detection

i have given the code for object detection in the "code" file.

but for a working experience, you need to have 3 file , in that two should be from COCO dataset, val2017 dataset and annotation 2017 img/val dataset.
and a text file named coco_lables.txt , here i will give the contents in coco_lables.txt in another file, check it out, and have an good experience.
